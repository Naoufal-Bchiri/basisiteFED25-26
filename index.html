						<h2>Save Hyrule—this time with Princess Zelda!</h2>
						<p>Princess Zelda was captured by Ganon, but the swordsman Link stormed in to rescue her. After a fierce battle, Link appeared to defeat the villain but was suddenly dragged down into a mysterious rift in the ground and disappeared.</p>
						<p>These rifts are appearing across the land, swallowing up others, including the King of Hyrule and his advisors.</p>
						<p>Left alone, it's now up to Princess Zelda to save her kingdom as she explores its vast regions, solves puzzles, and defeats foes in a brand-new adventure in the Legend of Zelda™ series!</p>
